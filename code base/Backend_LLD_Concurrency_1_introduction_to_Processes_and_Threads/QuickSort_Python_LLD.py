Parallel Quicksort Implementation
Problem Statement
You are tasked with creating a Python implementation of the Quicksort algorithm that utilizes parallel processing to improve performance.
The program should leverage the concurrent.futures module to achieve parallelism and sort an array efficiently.

Requirements
The program should include the following components:

quicksort function:
Takes an array as input.
Implements the Quicksort algorithm with parallel processing.
Selects a pivot element from the array.
Partitions the array into three parts: elements smaller than the pivot, elements equal to the pivot, and elements larger than the pivot.
Creates two separate threads using ThreadPoolExecutor to sort the left and right partitions concurrently.
Waits for the left and right partitions to be sorted, and then combines the results with the middle partition (elements equal to the pivot) to form the
final sorted array.
Returns the sorted array.
Example usage:
Generates a random sample array of integers.
Prints the original unsorted array.
Calls the quicksort function with the unsorted array.
Prints the sorted array.
Instructions
Implement the quicksort function according to the specified requirements.
Ensure that the function handles edge cases, such as an empty array or an array with a single element.
Implement the provided example usage to demonstrate the functionality of the parallel Quicksort implementation.
