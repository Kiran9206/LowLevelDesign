Observer Pattern for Weather Monitoring System
Problem Statement
You are developing a weather monitoring system that collects data from various sensors such as temperature, humidity, and pressure sensors. When any sensor reading goes beyond a predefined threshold, you need to trigger different types of processes specific to the type of the sensor. For example, if it is a temperature sensor, you need to send an alert to the air conditioning system. If it is a humidity sensor, you need to send an alert to the dehumidifier system. To achieve this, you want to implement the Observer pattern, allowing the sensors to notify the monitoring system when the sensor readings cross the threshold.

Assignment
Your goal is to implement the Observer pattern to refactor the existing WeatherMonitoringApplication class. The current class handles weather condition updates and notifications. Observer classes (e.g., TemperatureService, PressureService, HumidityService) need to be notified when any of the weather readings go beyond their respective thresholds.

You need to implement the observer pattern by first defining a method to notify observers in the Observer abstract class. Then, you need to implement the Observer interface and modify the observer classes to receive notifications. The observer side of the pattern is ready.

To implement the publisher side, the registry interface is provided to you through the ObserverRegistry abstract class. You need to implement the methods required by this class in the Publisher class. The Publisher class is a contract that defines the methods that a class can use to add, remove, and notify observers. The WeatherMonitoringApplication class will implement the Publisher class to notify observers when the weather readings cross the threshold.

Implementing the Observer Pattern
Review the original class: Study the WeatherMonitoringApplication class and its dependencies. Understand how it currently handles weather condition updates and triggers further actions.

Complete the observer interface: Design an interface named Observer with a method trigger that accepts the value as an argument. Add this method to the already provided Observer abstract class. This method will be used to notify observers when the weather readings cross the threshold.

Modify the concrete observers: Observer classes (such as TemperatureService, PressureService, HumidityService) will implement the Observer interface to receive notifications. Update the existing methods in these classes to match the new interface method signature.

Implement the publisher class: You have been provided with an empty Publisher class. The publisher class is a contract that defines the methods that a class can use to add, remove, and notify observers. The currently class will implement the Publisher class to notify observers when the weather readings cross the threshold. Your task is to first inherit the ObserverRegistry abstract class and then implement the methods defined by this class in the Publisher class. The ObserverRegistry class provides methods to add, remove, and notify observers. You just need to implement these methods in the Publisher class.

Modify the publisher: Refactor the WeatherMonitoringApplication class as required to implement the Publisher class. The WeatherMonitoringApplication class should now be able to add, remove, and notify observers. Also modify the method update_weather_conditions to notify observers when the weather readings cross the threshold.

Test your implementation: Run the provided test cases in the WeatherMonitoringApplicationTest class to ensure that your observer pattern implementation is correct. These test cases will check if observers are being notified correctly and if the WeatherMonitoringApplication behaves as expected.

Instructions
Add trigger method to the Observer abstract class.
Implement the Observer interface in the observer classes (TemperatureService, PressureService, HumidityService) to receive notifications.
Inherit the ObserverRegistry abstract class and implement the methods in the Publisher class to add, remove, and notify observers.
Modify the WeatherMonitoringApplication class to implement the Publisher class and notify observers when the weather readings cross the threshold.
Run the provided test cases in the WeatherMonitoringApplicationTest class to validate the correctness of your observer pattern implementation. Ensure that observers are being notified correctly and that the WeatherMonitoringApplication behaves as expected.
